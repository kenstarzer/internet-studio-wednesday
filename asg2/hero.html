<h1>The Tick</h1>
<h2>The Tick on TV</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="https://starzer.net/is1/img/Tick-pic-262x300.jpg" width="131" height="150" alt="The Tick" /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tick_%281994_TV_series%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tick: The Animated Series</a> is an American animated television series adaptation of the New England Comics superhero, The Tick. The series debuted September 10, 1994 on the Fox network's Fox Kids block and was responsible for introducing the satirical comic book character to a mainstream audience. Lasting three seasons, the final episode aired on November 24, 1996. Since then, The Tick has been syndicated by various networks, further increasing the show's cult following, and has been released on both VHS and DVD. A live-action series was created in 2001.</p>
<p>The Tick is an absurdist spoof of comic book superheroes. The Tick's sidekick is Arthur, a former accountant who dresses like a moth that flies. In the first episode, the Tick crashes a superhero convention to win the "protectorship" of The City.</p>
<p>The show's opening theme, written by Doug Katsaros, who also composed the scores for every episode, consists of big band music and campy scat singing. A typical episode plot would have The Tick battling a villain until Arthur devises a solution that saves the day. The Tick then declares an absurd moral regarding the previous conflict before the story comes to a close. Although the series was initially aimed primarily at children, it features an absurdist, parody style that appeals to an older audience as well.</p>
